    21 January 1924), better known by his alias Lenin,[c] was a Russian revolutionary,
    politician, and political theorist. He served as the first and founding head
    of government of Soviet Russia from 1917 to 1924 and of the Soviet Union from
    1922 to 1924. Under his administration, Russia, and later the Soviet Union, became
