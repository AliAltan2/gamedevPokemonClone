  description: "Mohammed VI (Arabic: \u0645\u062D\u0645\u062F \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062F\u0633)[1]
    is the King of Morocco. He belongs to the 'Alawi dynasty and ascended to the
    throne on 23 July 1999, upon the death of his father, King Hassan II.[2]\r\n\r\nUpon
    ascending to the throne, Mohammed initially introduced a number of reforms and
    changed the family code, Mudawana, which granted women more power.[3] Leaked
    diplomatic cables from WikiLeaks in 2010 led to allegations of corruption in
    the court of Mohammed, implicating him and his closest advisors.[4] Widespread
    disturbances in 2011, a Moroccan element of the Arab Spring, protested against
    corruption and urged political reform. In response, Mohammed promulgated a program
    of reforms and introduced a new constitution. These reforms were passed by a
    public referendum on 1 July 2011.[5]"
