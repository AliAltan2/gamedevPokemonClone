  name: Admiral-General Haffaz Aladeen
  description: For years, the fictional North African nation of the Republic of Wadiya
    (shown as coterminous with the boundaries of Eritrea on a map) has been ruled
    by Admiral-General Haffaz Aladeen, a childish, tyrannical, sexist, anti-Western,
    and antisemitic dictator who surrounds himself with female bodyguards, sponsors
    terrorism (especially giving shelter to al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden after
    "they killed his double one year ago"), changes many words in the Wadiyan dictionary
    to "Aladeen", and is working on developing nuclear weapons to attack Israel.
    He also refuses to sell Wadiya's oil fields, a promise he made to his father
    before his death. After the United Nations Security Council resolves to intervene
    militarily, Aladeen travels to the UN Headquarters in New York City to address
    the council.
