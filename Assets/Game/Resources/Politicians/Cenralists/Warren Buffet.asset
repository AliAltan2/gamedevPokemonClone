  name: 'Warren Buffet '
  description: Buffett has been the chairman and largest shareholder of Berkshire
    Hathaway since 1970.[8] He has been referred to as the "Oracle" or "Sage" of
    Omaha by global media.[9][10] He is noted for his adherence to value investing,
    and his personal frugality despite his immense wealth.[11] Research published
    at the University of Oxford characterizes Buffett's investment methodology as
    falling within "founder centrism", defined by a deference to managers with a
    founder's mindset, an ethical disposition towards the shareholder collective,
    and an intense focus on exponential value creation. Essentially, Buffett's concentrated
    investments shelter managers from the short-term pressures of the market.[12]
